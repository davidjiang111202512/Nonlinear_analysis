## Nonlinear analysis by OpenCV
### Goal: 
- Video analysis based on OpenCV 
- Colour catching by marking colour on the pendulum
- Data collection by tracking the movement of marked point

### Marked Point

After suitable image filter, one should get a video with only point movements. Under this position, the trajectory can be directly obtained

### Suitable Filter for high frequency noise
With properly threshold frequency attached with the device chosen, the trajectory becomes more smooth and precise
